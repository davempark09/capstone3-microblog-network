# Enjoy the Microblog Project and the MicroblogLite API!

Don't forget to read the [*MicroblogLite* API docs](https://microbloglite.herokuapp.com/docs/) and experiment with the API in *Postman!*

Practice and experimentation provide experience, and experience provides confidence.
This is our project on making a microblog posts that you can once you have login or make an account and see other people's posts.
One of the interesting piece that my partner made in javascript was making the cards for the post page.
